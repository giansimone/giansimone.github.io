                <p class="text-faded text-justify">I am a <b>computational scientist</b> and a <b>synthetic biologist</b>. I am interested in solving big problems using the power of computational science and control engineering. My research interests lie in <b>quantitative biology</b> and <b>cybergenetics</b>. The latter is an emerging – and relatively unknown – scientific domain at the frontier between control engineering and synthetic biology. I am very experienced in applying theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches – in particular, from dynamical systems and control theory – to quantitatively study the evolution of dynamical biosystems in time and space at different scales (molecules, cells, populations, and ecosystems). I am also experienced in building automated robotics platforms that enable big data collection and precise control in life science research. I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Bioengineering at the Imperial College London where I am a member of two amazing groups: the Control Engineering Synthetic Biology group headed by Prof Guy-Bart Stan, and the RLA lab headed by Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Systems and Synthetic Biology lab headed by Prof Diego di Bernardo at the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine in Italy. I was awarded a B.Sc in Computer Engineering (Summa cum laude), a M.Sc in Automation Engineering (Summa cum laude), and a Ph.D in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, all from University of Naples Federico II, Italy, on March 2009, October 2013, and May 2017, respectively.</p>

                <p class="text-faded text-justify">I'm working on a project that uses math to unravel the mysteries behind division of labour in synthetic microbial consortia. I am also studying innovative biomolecular control circuits implemented at host-cell level.</p>
